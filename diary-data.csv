1/1/2019,2019,January,Tuesday,"Today, I got up very early to make my first flight home. I slept on the first plane. I wrote in the San Francisco airport while waiting. I read a UX book on my second flight to Seattle. In Seattle, I waited for Cameron's plane to land, and then waited for her luggage. We took the link train back to the U District and then a Lyft back home. Shortly after that, I walked over to Safeway and picked up some ingredients for dinner. I made a new oven egg dish sort of like quiche. Cameron and I watched Seinfeld and went to bed. Today was a fine day. It was tiring because of the lack of sleep and the plane rides, but it wasn't bad. I'm happy to be back in Seattle! Today was a pretty good day. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I was happy at work. I like my coworkers and I am optimistic for my new work schedule.",3.5,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/2/2019,2019,January,Wednesday,"Today, I got up at around 8:30 and went to Starbucks. I got my free coffee with the promotional tumblr I purchased in December. I sat and I read my UX book and worked on other things on my to do list. Cameron arrived around noon. She was in a sore mood because she ""felt like a failure"" due to not having accomplished certain goals, e.g. talking to housemates more or landing a publishing deal. I did my best to cheer her up, but became cross when I perceived her to start bickering with me. We played Magic The Gathering. We went to Goodwill, then Trader Joe's, then the library, and then home. We played video games together - Cameron played Pokemon, and I played Resident Evil. Cameron then had another bout existential malaise. She cheered up after watching some silly videos. I went for a long walk and updated my journal and completed my step count goals. We then did SA and went to bed. Today was a good day, but I have to admit to getting frustrated with Cameron's mood swings. I know she feels bad about them.",3.0,0:49:09,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/3/2019,2019,January,Thursday,"Cameron and I went to Costa's for breakfast. I had a breakfast burrito, which was very filling. Then we went to Slate coffee, and played games and did some separate work time. Later, I took a trip downtown and went to Ike's Pot Shop, where I picked up an inexpensive vape and a marijuana cartridge for it. After that, I went for a long walk and relaxed with Cameron. We stayed up late and watched Bruce Almighty. Today was a pretty solid day. A little frustration in the morning (a coffeless boy was getting impatient with how long it takes Cameron to get up and ready...) but that was really the only issue.",3.5,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/4/2019,2019,January,Friday,"Cameron and I had a tense interaction to start the morning. Both of us have been getting generally irritated with each other, especially me with her in the morning. I went for a walk by myself, and we talked about it. I pushed for having morning alone time, since we've been spending so much uninterrupted time with each other. I really do think this is for the best; Cameron sleeps in and takes her time to get ready in the morning, while I can get up and go and be productive. It should work out. We went to Bean and Bagel and got breakfast, then parted ways. I worked on projects in starbucks, like UX stuff and writing, and she did hobbies at home. When I got back to the house, both of us were in much better moods. We played games, went for a walk, made pizza, watched Seinfeld, and had a good time. We did attempt SA, but it didn't work out. Raincheck. After this, Cameron played Stardew Valley and I figured out how to actually use the vape I purchased yesterday, and got nicely stoned. Today was a pretty good day. The morning conversation was tense but necessary. I feel better now that we made the plan we did. Tomorrow, I will get up and go to Starbucks alone. Cameron will meet up with me when she is ready - and then we will go downtown!",3.5,,"Cameron Eldridge, Mallory Herbst",,,,,,
1/5/2019,2019,January,Saturday,"Woke up early and went to starbucks to have some personal time. I didn't accomplish much that was fun, but I did put a dent in some things on my to-do list. Cameron met up with me afterwards. We caught a bus to the link, and then took the link downtown. We got salt bagels at Pike Place Market, stopped by Target, and then went to Anchorhead Cafe. We played games and worked on separate projects there. Eventually we left and went home to have dinner. I made falafal for the first time using a Trader Joe's mix, and played resident evil. Then Cameron and I hung out in the room for the rest of the evening, save for when I went for a brief walk. Today was a solid day. It was nice being downtown - I really have to remember that. I felt a little sad at the end of the day for unknown reasons, but it was pretty light. I also download Rogue Legacy at full price, which hopefully was a good decision.",3.5,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/6/2019,2019,January,Sunday,"Today, I slept in with Cameron and then we parted ways. She went to a work event of some sort; I caught a bus to Kirkland. I arrived in Kirkland at about 2:30. I hung out and talked to family, and played smash bros with Peter. I left after dinner. I stopped at Safeway on the way home, went upstairs and talked to the housemates with Cameron, and prepared for work the next day before bed. That night, I had a pretty hard time sleeping. On the whole, a good day.",3.5,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/7/2019,2019,January,Monday,"Today I got up very early to put stickers around the UW campus. Then I worked on UX stuff at starbucks before going to work early, where I cleaned out some drawers. I worked with a student I will refer to as Mr. Hudson today for the first time. It was fairly uneventful. After lunch I worked with my old student, who I will refer to as Treaty. Treaty's mood was a bit all over the place--he cried and laughed, was mellow and had bursts of energy. After work I wrote a quick parent email and did some grocery shopping. Then I rushed home to drop off my bags so I could go downtown to a UX event I wanted to attend. Cameron was in a dour mood when I arrived, and refused to talk about her day. I bused to the link and caught the link downtown. I accidentally attended the wrong lecture, but still gained some useful information. At home, I prepared for work and watched Cameron play a new video game. Today wasn't bad. Messing up the lecture I was supposed to attend wasn't that frustrating--it was actually sort of funny--but I am a little bummed I missed my UX event. Work was decent, though I was very tired all day because I slept poorly and got up extra early.",3.0,0:16:30,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/8/2019,2019,January,Tuesday,"I had a hard time getting going in Starbucks this morning. My coffee didn't seem to be very effective. I feel like there's something psychologically disarming about drinking coffee NOT from the paper cup - as in, the caffeine just doesn't work as well, nor does it taste as good. I went to work. Details from work not included. At home, Cameron was feeling down. I made dinner, and tried to cheer her up. We watched Community together and then had SA. It was all super good! I had to pace to get my 10000 steps before going to bed.",3.5,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/9/2019,2019,January,Wednesday,"Today, I tried to get work done at Starbucks but did not accomplish much. I went to work. Details from work are not included in this summary for privacy reasons.

1/11/2019,2019,January,Friday,"Today, I got up and spent some time in Starbucks before going to work. Work was pretty good; I got to work with Mr. Hudson all day while supporting Treaty. There was a staff meeting, and then I finished up work with my data. At happy hour, I got to talk to Emily and Gina and later talked to Peter about the reasons he was leaving APL. I even smoked some pot outside if A Pizza Mart with coworkers. At home, Cameron and I hung out for a bit before she went off to a Velvet Q concert. I went for a walk up to a new Safeway while vaping. I played Rogue Legacy at home and then went to bed.",4.0,0:12:58,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/12/2019,2019,January,Saturday,"Today, I went to work in the morning. I tried to get as much stuff done there as possible. I picked up a flower for Cameron at the Saturday market.

Then we grabbed dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, which was really pleasant. We played video games at home while I was a bit high off the vape pen we bought.",4.0,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
1/13/2019,2019,January,Sunday,"Today, Cameron and I got and prepared to go to the Fremont Sunday Market. My mission there was to gift hunt; I successfully found a gift for my dad's birthday all the way in september, but no gift for either my mom or brother, whose birthdays are more immediate. We went to a new cafe after that - Milstead - and played yugioh. At home, I made enchiladas while Cameron cleaned out her extremely messy clothes situation, and when the food was done, we watched the first episode of Mob Psycho 100 season 2. Then I went for a walk, and when I returned, great SA.",4.0,,Cameron Eldridge,,,,,,
