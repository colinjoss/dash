# diary-assistant

diary-assistant is a program that facilitates the maintenance of my
personal diary.

Since I was 16, I've journaled my life through MP3 voice 
recordings and an accompanying spreadsheet of life data. Each
recording is a diary entry, and the spreadsheet provides 
much-needed context to these entries.

This is how the diary spreadsheet is currently structured:

diary-assistant uses this data to calculate statistics,
perform search operations, and help me update the spreadheet.
I can also just modify the spreadsheet directly.
